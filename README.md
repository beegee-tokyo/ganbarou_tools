Ganbarou Tools
My tools and files used to build a CM10 based Ganbarou ROM for Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Galaxy Note
======================================================================================================
In tools:
---------
custom squisher 
- out file name changed to cm-base_for_ganbarou.zip for easier post-processing in ganbarou.sh
- removed creation of md5 checksum because this will be done in the post-processing
Added all batch files that are used to make the ROMs. Need to be copied as link to the top build directory
Added copy of local_manifest.xml and changelog
